## Running Backend and Frontend

This guide will walk you through the steps to run both the backend and frontend of this application. The backend is powered by Node.js, and the frontend utilizes Vite.

### Backend Setup

1. **Install Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the root directory of the project in your terminal and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

3. **Run Backend**: Once the dependencies are installed, start the backend server by running: ```node index.js```

This command will start the backend server, and you should see a message indicating that the server is running.

## Frontend Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have npm installed. Navigate to the `frontend` directory of the project and run: ```npm install```

This will install the necessary dependencies for the frontend.

2. **Run Frontend**: After installing dependencies, start the frontend development server by running: ```npm run dev```

This command will compile the frontend code and start a development server. Once the compilation is complete, you should be able to access the frontend of the application in your web browser.
